<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->



<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized Tailwind in order to create responsive web application.
* Implemented Api from Coin Gecko - https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation
* Self made assets such as the cards in figma 

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* How important Google Analytics is. Searching constantly for ways to improve. And how Google Analytics can give you this information.
* Creating a card game with js was interesting and fun, wish I could have expanded upon it more.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Getting my website to show on google.
* First idea with card system was to give or take cards based on if you lose or win the game. Which proved to be difficult with the time given.


#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Tailwind instead of bootstrap
* Instead of using col-3 within your div class you now use col-span-3. Wihtin tailwind you lose access to css as well and any styling is donw with the div class. Any additional colors, fonts, images should be added in the tailwind.config.js

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* revamping the card game
* Looking at more design examples

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
## Final Outcome

### Mockups

<!-- note how you can use your gitHub link. Just make a path to your assets folder -->
